A representative layer from each stratum is plotted. Note that nodes in all networks are colored according to their community membership in stratum 1. Each network has $N=128$ nodes, $K=4$ communities and mean degree, $c=20$. The $p_{in}^s$ parameters for $s=1,$ $2$ and 3 are 0.6, 0.4 and 0.25, respectively. Corresponding values of $p_{out}^s$ were selected to maintain the desired expected mean degree, c=20. {\bf  B}. We fit 3 types of models to the 30 network layers: i) single SBM: fitting a single SBM to all of the layers; ii) single-Layer SBM: fitting an individual SBM to each layer; and iii) sMLSBM: identifying strata and fitting an SBMs for each strata. Each model yields an estimate $\overline  {{\boldsymbol  \pi }^{s_l}}$ for the true SBM of each layer $l$, which is denoted ${{\boldsymbol  \pi }}^{l}$. Here $s_l$ denotes the inferred strata for layer $l$.

For stratum 1, we fixed the quantity $N(p_{{in}}^{1}-p_{{out}}^{1})=10$, which fully specifies $(p_{{in}}^{1},p_{{out}}^{1})$ since setting $c=16$ also constrains these parameters.
